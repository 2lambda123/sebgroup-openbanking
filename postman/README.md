###  Step 4. Test PSD2 APIs with sandbox
1. Authorization

   Each collection includes 2 authorizations, you can choose Redirect or Decoupled authorization for your needs. Refer the steps below for instruction. 
   
2. You are ready to call the API with your access token.


## Authorization
The Authorization APIs provide for an authorization & authentication mechanism for SEBs APIs. These APIs are used to obtain security tokens for protected APIs. We offer the redirect and decoupled authorization and you can test both from our sandbox.
Read [PSD2 Authorization](https://developer.sebgroup.com/products/authorization) for more information.

### Redirect Authorization 

1. Request approval for an Authorization Code
Obtaining the authorization code is an interactive process, which requires you to log in as a user. **It requires you to execute the request in the browser**   
You could find a uri to copy by clicking [Send] button from [GET] Request approval for an Authorization Code (look at the console window in the bottom of your postman)
