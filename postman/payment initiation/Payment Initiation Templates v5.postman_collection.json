All the field content that is prefixed with “TPP:” should be populated with the relevant data and remove the \"TPP:\" prefix.\n\nThe filled-in template can then be used as payment inititation payload. The name of the template will be used in the payments endpoint when creating the payment initiation, i.e. POST /payments/swedish-domestic-private-bankgiros\n\nThe templates are static so once a template has been fetched, it can be cached on the client side and be reused for future payments.\n\nNote that the debtor account (sender) is always an IBAN for non-corporate payment types and the creditor account is dependent on the selected template (payment product). For corporate payment products sender is always a BBAN + BIC. The available debtor accounts can either be obtained from the customer or by using the accounts API."
