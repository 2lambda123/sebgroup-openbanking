Sandbox (test) certificates
===========================

Use these certificates when calling our sandbox API's.

The certificate password is 'qwerty', currently ranked in third place among the [world's most popular passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords).

The PSD2 folder contains certificates for PSD2 API's:
* Account Information
* Payment Initiation

For all other API's requiring a certificate, use `open-banking.pfx`.
