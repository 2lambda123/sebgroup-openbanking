# Contingency Mechanism

SEB provides a fallback solution to licensed TPPs described in [PSD2_Fallback_Documentation_SEB_AB_SEB_Kort.pdf](PSD2_Fallback_Documentation_SEB_AB_SEB_Kort.pdf).

The PSD2 APIs is the _primary channel_ for third party providers to access customer data and the fallback solution should only be used as a contingency solution in accordance with the PSD2 directive.
